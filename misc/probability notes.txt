P(chris) = .5
P(sara) = .5

P("love deal", chris) = .1 * .8 * .5 = .04
P("love deal", sara) = .5 * .2 * .5 =  .05

norm = .09

p(chris | "love deal") = .04 / .09 = .44
p(sara, "love deal") = .05 / .09 = .55

p(love deal, chris) = .1 * .8 * .5 = .04
p(love deal, sara) = .5 * .2 * .5 = .05
p(ld, cs) = .09


P(a,b) = P(a|b)P(b)
P(a,b) = P(b|a)P(a)
-->
P(A|B) = P(B|A)*P(A)/P(B)
P(b|a) = P(a|b)P(b) / P(a)


P(t, l) = .20 / .25 = .8

P(a certain word|surrounding words) = P(surrounding words|a certain word)*P(a certain word) / P(surrounding words)

So if you could just go ahead and pack up your stuff and move it down there, that would be terrific, OK?

for this time = .4 * .6 = .24
for this job = .4 * .4 = .16
for that job = .3 * .8 = .24
for that time = .3 * .2 = .06
for those items = .3 * .1 = .3

time = .3
job = .4

Accuracy: Number of correct predictions made divided by the total number of predictions made, multiplied by 100 to turn it into a percentage

Recall: True Positive / (True Positive + False Negative). Out of all the items that are truly positive, how many were correctly classified as positive. Or simply, how many positive items were 'recalled' from the dataset.

Precision: True Positive / (True Positive + False Positive). Out of all the items labeled as positive, how many truly belong to the positive class.

The F1 score can be interpreted as a weighted average of the precision and recall, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 and worst at 0:

F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)

###################

mode:  value with highest frequency
median:  value in the middle
avg:  avg

when uniform distribution, there can be no mode
there can be multi-modal distributions
the mode occurs on the X-axis
mode can be a category as well as a numerical

mean can be misleading due to outliers
median is robust, is not affected much by departures of the norm

mean, median, mode => measures of center

Outlier < Q1 - 1.5(IQR)
